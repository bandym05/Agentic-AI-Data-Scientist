## 🧠 What is Agentic AI?

Built on top of **Llama 3 (via Groq)** and **PandasAI**, it combines the power of conversational AI with real-time data analysis to help you:
- Understand your data
- Generate meaningful visualizations
- Engineer features
- Clean messy datasets
- Ask questions in plain language
- Download insights and charts effortlessly

🗨️ Just ask questions like:
- *“How many columns are in this dataset?”*

- *“What are the missing values in the dataset?”*
- *“Show me the top 10 performing products.”*
